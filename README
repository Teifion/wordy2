Built from a combination of the old Wordy and the Ultimate O's and X's game I wrote. The idea was to take into account the lesson's I'd learned, practice porting a code-base I'm not so familiar with and then add matchmaking + unit tests.

INSTALLATION
Traverse to your_route/wordy/install. Wordy will ask you to select the word file and allow you to upload it.
Wordy will accept CSV, TSV, New line and Space separated words so will hopefully work with almost any wordlist.

Once installed Wordy will disable the installation page (by HTTP forwarding people away).



I made this project to add to a program at work. This software is released under a BSD license (do what you want with it but I'm not to blame for anything that happens as a result).
